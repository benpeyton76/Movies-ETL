# ***Movies ETL***

## ***Overview:***
This module introduces the concept behind ETL and why it is a key tool for data processing. ETL, which stands for Extract, Transform, Load, is a method used to clean and structure raw data before it can be analyzied. "Extract" is the process of reading the data, often from multiple sources, the "transform" phase cleans and structures data to the desired form, and "load" is writing the data into a database for use and storage.
